# UVM Verification Project (Ongoing)

This repository contains an ongoing SystemVerilog UVM verification
environment developed as part of structured learning and upskilling.

The DUT used is provided in the course [Design Verification with SystemVerilog & UVM](https://www.udemy.com/course/design-verification-with-systemverilog-uvm/?couponCode=ACCAGE0923). The EDA playground link has the latest UVM testbench code that can be used for simulation and waveform observation.
